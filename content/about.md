# Welcome To Failed Commits

Not sure what all to say other then thanks for stopping by to read this. I created this website in hopes that people will feel free to see all the broken/unfinished projects I work on and maybe it'll help someone else finish theirs.

I have always been the type of person to get an idea or see something and want to try it for myself even with my lack of dev experience. However, I also feel the best way to learn is to fail.
